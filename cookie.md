# simple cookie recipe
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter (melted)
3 egg
2 tsp vanilla
2 1/2 cup flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
pinch of salt
chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). In a bowl, mix melted butter + sugars. Add egg and vanilla, mix 
well. Add flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Scoop 
spoonfuls onto a baking tray (leave space). Bake 10–12 minutes until edges are lightly golden.
Let cool 5 minutes (they get better after resting)
